# P2P Chat
A peer-to-peer chatting app!
Ever wonder what happens to your messages in those other chat apps? They send them on a little adventure to some far-off server, and who knows what's going on there! But not here. With this app, it's direct and personal. You chat directly with your pals! It's like your messages are on a private express lane. ðŸš€ More security, more speed â€“ that's what this app is all about! ðŸ˜„
